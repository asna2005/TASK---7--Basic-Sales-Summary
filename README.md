# ðŸ§¾ Task 7 â€“ Basic Sales Summary using SQLite and Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To use SQL inside Python to pull basic sales information (total quantity sold and total revenue) and display it using print statements and simple visualizations.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python  
- SQLite3  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  

---

## ðŸ“˜ Steps Performed
1. Connected Python to a local SQLite database (sales_data.db)
2. Created a small table named sales with product, quantity, and price data
3. Executed an SQL query to calculate:
   - Total quantity sold  
   - Total revenue (quantity Ã— price)
4. Displayed results using Pandas DataFrame
5. Visualized results using Matplotlib bar and pie charts

## ðŸ“Š Visualization
- *Bar Chart:* Revenue by Product  
- *Bar Chart:* Quantity Sold by Product  
- *Pie Chart:* Revenue Share by Product  
- *Scatter Plot:* Quantity vs Revenue

## ðŸ“ˆ Output Example
| Product     | Total Quantity | Total Revenue |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| Laptop       | 5              | 250000        |
| Phone        | 8              | 160000        |
| Headphones   | 10             | 15000         |
| Tablet       | 3              | 90000         |
| Charger      | 15             | 12000         |

## âœ… Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL and Python can work together for basic data analysis and visualization.  
It shows how to extract, summarize, and visualize sales data using a simple SQLite database.
